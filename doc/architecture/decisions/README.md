# Recording Architecture Decisions

We record the architectural decisions made on the SDC project in this folder. We use the standard PR process to review and approve decisions.

We use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Process

1. Create a branch for your proposed architecture change 
2. Create a markdown document in this folder with sections *Context*, *Decision* and *Consequences*.
3. Raise a PR

All architecture decisions are presumed ratified once the PR is approved and merged. Github serves as the documentation of discussion.
