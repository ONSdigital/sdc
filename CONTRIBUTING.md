Contributing to Survey Data Collection repositories
===================================================

* We use [github-flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) - create a branch from master with a short, concise, name, e.g. (nb. there are no specific prefixes):
    * add-user-auth
    * fix-ioloop-bug
    * update-cryptography-version
* Pull requests must contain a succinct, clear summary of what the user need is driving this feature change
* Ensure your branch contains logical atomic commits before sending a pull request - follow the [alphagov Git styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
* You may rebase your branch after feedback if it's to include relevant updates from the master branch. We prefer a rebase here to a merge commit as we
prefer a clean and straight history on master with discrete merge commits for features
